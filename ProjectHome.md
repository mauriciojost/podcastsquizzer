### When should I use it? ###

You should use this application when you as a podcasts' listener need more tools to improve your skills during your listening.

While you're listening to a podcast, you'll be able to add marks associated to your podcast's file, and then write a comment about each one: explaining something new or rather confusing to you, or just writing about what it's being said, you choose!

Here you have a demonstration:
