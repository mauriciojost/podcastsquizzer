This is a J2ME mobile application to help podcasts' listeners to have a nicer experience while learning.

## When should I use it?

You should use this application when you as a podcasts' listener need more tools to improve your skills during your listening sessions.

While you're listening to a podcast, you'll be able to add time-marks associated to your podcast's audio file, and then write a comment about each one, for instance explaining something new or rather confusing to you, or just writing about what it's being said, you choose!

Here you have a [demonstration in Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtYFSzaS7Nw). 

I'll be uploading the last available screenshot here:

This application was created while listening [BetterAtEnglish](http://www.betteratenglish.com/) podcasts.
