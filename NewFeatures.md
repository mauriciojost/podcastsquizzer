# Introduction #

This mobile application can help you to take advantage of your _podcasts_! Add your own information to them!

If you learn English, Spanish, or any other language by using podcasts, and you have a mobile phone that supports J2ME (most of the modern ones), then this program is for you. You could use your podcasts and the transcripts in order to create your own _animated_ _transcripts_ to read and hear at the same time! After that you could add your own comments for each piece of listening (vocabulary, meaning of idioms, etc.). All that information is saved in a way that you will be able to read it all later in a computer!
